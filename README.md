# SageMaker Deployment Project

The objective of the project is to implement a model to analyze the sentiment of movie reviews. This model is consumed through an API that generates a prediction of whether the review is positive or negative.

The model is a recurring neural network using PyTorch, however, we take advantage of the Amazon SageMaker integration with Frameworks such as: PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn, among others, to build custom models different from those provided by AWS.

The architecture looks as follows:
